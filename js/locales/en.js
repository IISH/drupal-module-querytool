The two formats serve different purposes. The historical classification is closest to the source, although unified and systematised, and generally offers a greater level of detail. The modern classification usually distinguishes between a smaller number of categories, but is 100% comparable over time, as well as to other countries and regions when internationally accepted taxonomies have been used.
